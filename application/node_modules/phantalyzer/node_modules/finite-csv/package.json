If you have a cell in Excel that includes a carriage return then it seems that most CSV parsers fail.\n\nThe other issue I've found with most parsers is that they require you to either enclose all or none of the fields in quotes.  Excel and other programs will output fields that use quotes only when the contents contain commas or carriage returns.\n\nFinite state machine are probably better used for workflows but I wanted to demonstrate how easy this would be to build using a state machine.  Debugging was simple and it was easy to find errors.\n",
